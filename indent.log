latexindent version 2.1R, a script to indent .tex files
latexindent lives here: /usr/local/texlive/2016/texmf-dist/scripts/latexindent/

Directory for backup files and indent.log: .
Reading defaultSettings.yaml from /usr/local/texlive/2016/texmf-dist/scripts/latexindent/defaultSettings.yaml

Home directory is /home/giuseppe
To specify user settings you would put indentconfig.yaml here: 
	/home/giuseppe/indentconfig.yaml

Alternatively, you can use the hidden file .indentconfig.yaml as: 
	/home/giuseppe/.indentconfig.yaml


Backup procedure:

	 copying ripper.tex to ./ripper.bak0

	 Backup file: ./ripper.bak0
	 Overwriting file: ripper.tex
